# Description:
# Final task:
#   Create a tool which will calculate straight-line distance between different cities based on coordinates:
#   1. User will provide two city names by console interface
#   2. If tool do not know about city coordinates, it will ask user for input and store it in SQLite database for future use
#   3. Return distance between cities in kilometers
#   Do not forgot that Earth is a sphere, so length of one degree is different.
